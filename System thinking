A system has a function, and when connected to other systems, they become subsystems of a wider system.
A system can be defined as a series of connected elements with a goal or single effect.

Need of system thinking:
--> We can sometimes lose sight of a system and become fixated on elements.
Interconnected Systems:
We can change single elements in a system and see the impact on the whole system.
They provide leverage because we achieve a larger effect through the system than if the element we changed was somehow isolated.
