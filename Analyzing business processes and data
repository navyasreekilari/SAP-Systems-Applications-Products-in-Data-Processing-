BPA: It is a detailed, multiphase evaluation of each part of a business process.
It is designed to identify:
. What is working well
. What needs to be improved or changed
. How best to make those changes and improvements.

Business processes model notation (BPMN) allows us to visualize either the individual processes or the network of processes.

Desired outcomes of BPA include:
. Cost savings
. Increased revenue
. Improved customer and staff engagement and satisfaction
. More efficient workflows
. Better alignment with key performance indicators (KPIs)

BPA process outline:
--> Define the problem
--> Measure the process
--> Analyze the process and the problem with stakeholders
--> Improve the process by addressing issues and areas of concern.
--> Control the new processes we have put in place

BPA Methodologies:
. Six Sigma: It is an analytical, data-driven, five- to seven-step method used to reduce errors or defects and improve processes.
. Lean Six Sigma:Combines the Lean philosophy to eliminate defects and reduce waste with the six sigma method.

Analysis using BPMN:
. Value analysis
. Root analysis
. Gap analysis
