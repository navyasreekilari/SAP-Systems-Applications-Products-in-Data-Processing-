We can use analytical frameworks, including PESTLE, Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), and systems diagrams, to effectively evaluate the impact of factors 
affecting a company's systems, technology, business processes and environments.

SYSTEMS DIAGRAMS:
---> Means for analyzing and understanding business process systems.
---> Provides a high-level overview from input through output

We can create Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)
---> Used to visualize the systems and specific business processes used within them
---> High-level PESTLE to low-level BPMN.
---> Analysis details increase
